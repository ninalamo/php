# Laravel Docker MySQL Starter

This repository was generated using a complete, step‑by‑step Docker setup for a Laravel application with MySQL. All necessary Docker configuration files, environment settings, and Laravel code were generated using the instructions contained in this README. **You no longer need to re-run these steps unless you want to start the project from scratch or significantly modify the setup.**

## Overview

This project is a Laravel application fully containerized using Docker. The environment includes:
- **App Container:** Runs Laravel (based on the `php:8.2-fpm` image) with Composer and additional tools.
- **Database Container:** Uses MySQL 8 to provide the database.
- **Docker Compose:** Connects the containers with proper networking and persistent storage via a named volume.

The repository was generated by following these steps:
1. **Creating the Laravel project** using a Dockerized Composer command.
2. **Setting up the `.env` file** with the correct database and session settings.
3. **Creating a `docker-compose.yml` file** that defines the app and MySQL services.
4. **Creating a `Dockerfile`** that installs system dependencies, Composer, and PHP extensions, and includes a wait loop to ensure MySQL is ready.
5. **Building and starting the containers,** followed by generating and running database migrations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- A terminal or command-line interface

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Containers:**

   The repository comes with all the necessary configuration. Simply run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the Laravel application image based on the provided `Dockerfile`
   - Start both the **app** (Laravel) and **db** (MySQL) containers
   - Attach a persistent volume for MySQL data

3. **Verify Container Status:**

   Check that the containers are running correctly:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the Laravel welcome page.

## Database Migrations

If you are using database sessions (or other features that require database tables), you must run migrations:

1. **Generate the Sessions Table Migration (if needed):**

   If you are using `SESSION_DRIVER=database`, generate the migration by running:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it laravel_app php artisan session:table
   ```

2. **Run Migrations:**

   Apply all migrations (including the sessions table migration):

   ```bash
   docker exec -it laravel_app php artisan migrate
   ```

> **Note:** If you prefer not to use database sessions, update your `.env` file with `SESSION_DRIVER=file` and clear the config cache:
>
> ```bash
> docker exec -it laravel_app php artisan config:clear
> ```

## Troubleshooting

- **MySQL Configuration Error:**  
  The `docker-compose.yml` does not include `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` for the **db** service (only `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is used). This is because the root user should only be configured with `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

- **DNS/Networking Issues:**  
  Laravel connects to MySQL using `DB_HOST=db`. If you encounter DNS issues, inside the app container, run:
  
  ```bash
  docker exec -it laravel_app sh -c "getent hosts db"
  ```
  
  or
  
  ```bash
  docker exec -it laravel_app nslookup db
  ```

- **Waiting for MySQL:**  
  The `Dockerfile` uses a wait loop (`nc -z db 3306`) to ensure MySQL is accepting connections before the Laravel server starts.

- **Rebuilding Containers:**  
  If changes are made to the Dockerfile or configuration files, rebuild the containers with:
  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

## Notes

- The repository was generated using the steps outlined in this README. Once generated, you no longer need to re-run these steps unless you want to start from scratch or drastically change your setup.
- All configuration files (including `.env`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`) are provided in this repository.
- The project uses Docker to isolate the application environment, so you do not need to install PHP, Composer, or MySQL on your local machine.
